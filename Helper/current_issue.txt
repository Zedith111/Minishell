Current Issue


1) When in cat command, signal not working. ctrl + \ should quit cat only,
	but now quit whole minishell

2) Some built in (export, unset, cd) not working, due to execute in child process

3) unset PATH, then ls, still need to check, due to unset not working now

4) When prompt error message, now need to exit twice
