outfile without command will create new
infile without command do nothing
multilple infile read the last one
	cat < Makefile < srcs/ms_exit.c | cat > out --> read ms_exit
multilple outfile will write to last one 
	cat < Makefile < srcs/ms_exit.c | cat > out >note2.txt -->write to note2


cd
	when path is not provided, will set to HOME
	if - is use, it will set to OLDPWD

export will sort and add declare -x in front of name
	export will not resort when new variable added, newly added will always be last

env will show envirenment variable only, but not local variabe
	env not show variable if not define. export a will not show, export a="hi" will show
	when execute env, check whether the first character is '\0' indicating is empty. If is empty, dont print


when expand a variable that is not present in environment, will return empty string
if  only $ is used, treat is as the character only. echo $ print out $

"ls" & 'ls' will work, but "ls -a" & 'ls -a' will not, ls "-l -a" 

in env, contain _=/usr/bin/env which is the path of program
in export contain OLDPWD

To do
	parser
	when expand, might need to add \ before special character
	expander might need to append the result to previous string.
	echo $PATH$USER produce
		/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/munkizah
